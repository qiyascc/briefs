### **High-Volume File Sharing Platform Using Kafka and Spring Boot**

---

#### **Project Name:**
**FileFlow**  
*(High-Volume File Sharing and Processing Platform)*

---

#### **Project Objective:**
This project aims to create a platform that allows users to securely and efficiently share **high-volume files** with each other. The platform will be developed using **Kafka** and **Spring Boot** and will include features such as file sharing, file processing, notifications, and user management. The project will serve as a reference for **distributed systems**, **message queues**, and **high-performance file processing**.

---

### **Project Features:**

1. **User Management:**
   - User registration, login, and authentication (JWT-based).
   - User profile management (name, email, profile picture, etc.).

2. **File Sharing:**
   - Users can send high-volume files (e.g., over 1 GB) to each other.
   - Files are split into chunks and transmitted via Kafka.
   - Real-time progress tracking during file uploads.

3. **File Processing:**
   - Files are processed via Kafka (e.g., compression, format conversion, virus scanning).
   - Processed files are stored and notifications are sent to the recipient.

4. **Notification System:**
   - Notifications are sent to users during file uploads and downloads (e.g., email, push notifications).
   - Notifications are processed and delivered to users via Kafka.

5. **Storage and Backup:**
   - Files are securely stored (e.g., AWS S3, Google Cloud Storage, or local file system).
   - Files are backed up and archived.

6. **Scalability and High Performance:**
   - High-volume file traffic is managed using Kafka’s distributed architecture.
   - The system is scalable using a microservices architecture with Spring Boot.

---

### **Technological Stack:**

1. **Backend:**
   - **Spring Boot:** REST APIs, user management, file processing, and notification services.
   - **Kafka:** Transmission of file chunks, event-driven processing, and notifications.
   - **Spring Kafka:** Spring Boot integration for Kafka.
   - **Spring Security:** User authentication and authorization.
   - **JWT (JSON Web Token):** Secure session management.

2. **Storage:**
   - **AWS S3 / Google Cloud Storage:** Storage of high-volume files.
   - **MongoDB / PostgreSQL:** Storage of user information, file metadata, and notifications.

3. **Frontend (Optional):**
   - **React.js / Angular:** User interface.
   - **WebSocket:** Real-time notifications and file upload progress tracking.

4. **Other Tools:**
   - **Docker:** Running microservices as containers.
   - **Kubernetes:** Ensuring scalability and high availability.
   - **Prometheus & Grafana:** Monitoring system performance.

### **System Architecture:**

1. **User Interface:**
   - A web interface for users to upload, download, and view notifications.

2. **API Gateway:**
   - A central API Gateway (Spring Cloud Gateway) to route all requests.

3. **Microservices:**
   - **Auth Service:** User authentication and authorization.
   - **File Service:** File upload, download, and processing.
   - **Notification Service:** Creation and delivery of notifications.
   - **Storage Service:** Storage and management of files.

4. **Kafka:**
   - **Transmission of File Chunks:** Files are split into chunks and sent to Kafka topics.
   - **Event-Driven Processing:** File uploads, processing, and notifications are managed via Kafka.

5. **Storage and Database:**
   - Files are stored in cloud storage systems.
   - User information and file metadata are stored in a database.

### **Flow Diagram:**

1. **File Upload:**
   - User uploads a file → File is split into chunks → Chunks are sent to Kafka → File is processed and stored → Notification is sent to the recipient.

2. **File Download:**
   - User requests to download a file → File metadata is checked → File is retrieved from storage → File is delivered to the user.

3. **Notifications:**
   - Notifications are created via Kafka during file uploads or downloads → Notification service delivers them to the user.

---

### **Project Steps:**

1. **Kafka Setup:**
   - Start Kafka broker and Zookeeper.
   - Create necessary topics (`file-uploads`, `file-processing`, `notifications`, etc.).

2. **Spring Boot Project Setup:**
   - Create Spring Boot projects for microservices.
   - Add dependencies for Spring Kafka, Spring Security, and others.

3. **File Upload and Processing:**
   - Develop a service to split files into chunks and send them to Kafka.
   - Develop a Kafka Streams application for file processing (e.g., compression, format conversion).

4. **Notification System:**
   - Develop a service to create notifications via Kafka and deliver them to users.

5. **Storage Integration:**
   - Integrate with AWS S3 or Google Cloud Storage.

6. **Frontend (Optional):**
   - Develop a user interface and integrate it with the backend APIs.

---

### **Expected Outcomes:**
This project provides a comprehensive solution for **high-volume file sharing** and **event-driven processing** using Kafka and Spring Boot. The system is **scalable**, **high-performance**, and **secure**. It serves as an excellent reference for developers working on distributed systems and message queues. 

---

### **Key Benefits:**
- **Scalability:** Kafka’s distributed architecture ensures the system can handle high traffic.
- **Performance:** Efficient file processing and real-time notifications.
- **Security:** Secure file storage and JWT-based authentication.
- **Flexibility:** Modular microservices architecture allows for easy updates and scalability.
